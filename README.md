# Design of a PID controller using the Ziegler-Nichols 1 and 2 methods
The Ziegler-Nichols method allows defining proportional, integral and derivative gains by means of a PID controller from the system (plant) response in open loop or closed loop, empirically, without knowing the equations that describe the plant.
A PID controller was designed using the Ziegler - Nichols 1 method for the plant (1), and the 2 method for the plant (2). Its stability was also verified by the Routh - Hurwitz stability criterion
